## About

The Solar System 3D Simulation is designed to provide an intuitive and interactive way to explore the solar system. Users can view planetary motion, rotations, and relative positions in real-time. The project leverages WebGL for rendering 3D graphics directly in the browser.

## Features

- 3D rendering of planets, moons, and the sun.
- Realistic planetary orbits and rotations.
- Zoom and pan functionality for a closer look at celestial objects.
- Lightweight and runs directly in the browser.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies are utilized in this project:

- **JavaScript**: Core scripting for functionality and logic.
- **WebGL**: For rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the web interface.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iSaurabhMeshram28/solarSystem3DSim.git
   cd solarSystem3DSim
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   - Simply double-click the file, or
   - Serve the project using a local server (e.g., `http-server` or `Live Server` in VS Code):
     ```bash
     npx http-server
     ```

3. Explore the solar system in your browser!

Happy exploring the solar system! ðŸŒŒ
